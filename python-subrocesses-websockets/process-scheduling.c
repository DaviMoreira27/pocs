/*
    The process scheduler selects an available process (ready state)
    to be executed by the CPU

    If a process with a higher priority needs to be executed, then the scheduler will block
    the current execution process and pass the cpu time to the one that has the priority

    The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues:

    Job Queue -> All the process in the system

    Ready Queue -> The process that are in the main memory and are ready and waiting
    to be executed

    Device queues âˆ’ The processes which are blocked due to unavailability
    of an I/O device constitute this queue.
*/

// !IMPORTANT: Execute the output as root

/*
    Apparently, if the output is not executed as root, the script can only use the kernel dynamic sched
    policy, because the other sched policies are priviliged
*/

/*
    Output:

    - The SCHED_OTHER is the default policy of the kernel, its used mainly for process that do not have a special
    priority, it will request more time when there are a lot of context switchs and the process cannot be executed continuously

    - In the Round Robin policy, all the process have an equally space time
    to be executed by the CPU, when that times reaches its end, the CPU will handle the next
    process in the queue, until that process has the opportunity to be executed again.

    - The FIFO policy is no preemptive policy, that means that when its started to be executed, it will
    continue until the process is finished or needs to perform an IO operation. He is probably the main
    reason for why the SCHED_OTHER is taking so much time.
